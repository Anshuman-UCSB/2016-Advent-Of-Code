Any complete pairs on floor 1 add 12 steps to the solution

Complete pairs on floor 2 add 8 steps

Complete pairs on floor 3 add 4 steps

The first floor contains a thulium generator, a thulium-compatible microchip, a plutonium generator, and a strontium generator.
The second floor contains a plutonium-compatible microchip and a strontium-compatible microchip.
The third floor contains a promethium generator, a promethium-compatible microchip, a ruthenium generator, and a ruthenium-compatible microchip.
The fourth floor contains nothing relevant.

Thulium - T
Plutonium - P
Strontium - S
Promethium - O
Ruthenium - R

A unpaired Chip (XC) cannot be with another generator (YG)
Two generators (XG, YG) are safe
Two unpaired chips (XC, YC) are safe, as long as there is no generator (ZG)
A pair is safe (XC XG) but an unpaired chip cannot be on the same floor
